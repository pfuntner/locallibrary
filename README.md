# locallibrary - Going through Mozilla tutorial for Django

While learing about Django, I was told about [Django Web Framework (Python)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django).

* This made a lot of sense to me and had a good pace for an experienced developer.
* I was performing the steps on my Windows while starting a new job that involves Django.
* I prefer using Cygwin as my Windows shell but was having trouble getting it work so with the steps so I settled on using the Windows command prompt at the start.  I really hate that command prompt but I could carry out the steps.
* I had also installed [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) but was having trouble with Django tutorials using that.  But at a point in the Mozilla tutorial, I felt comfortable enough to:
  * Create an empty PyCharm Django project
  * Migrate the files I was changing from the tutorial into the PyCharm project
  * I had to do some housekeeping with Django data migration and creating a superuser but that was pretty easy
  * I also lost all of the data in my _database_ but it there wasn't a lot and it gave me a chance to re-do it in my strange style - instead of creating books and authors in the database, I was creating music albums and artists
  * Moving forward, I was enjoying using PyCharm to carry out the tutorial.  I didn't have to use the nasty Windows command prompt and could just move between three windows:
    * The tutorial pages
    * PyCharm
    * My browser that was visiting the Django site I was creating
    
    I'm using PyCharm with some work related to my job so this was a way to become more comfortable with the IDE.

  I imagine you could do something similar to get my stuff working for you if you like.
  
## Things to do
* Do more with the tutorial
* ~~Finish the challenge of creating the list view for librarians use only~~
* Figure out what _virtual envivronment_ does for me - I have no idea!

## Official Repo
There is an [official repository with a final working version of the tutorial](https://github.com/mdn/django-locallibrary-tutorial) - I think it carried out all the _challenges_ too.  They mention it occasionally throughout the tutorial but not often enough, in my humble opinion.
